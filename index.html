    <h1>The Raven</h1>
    <h2>EDGAR ALLAN POE</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, <br>
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, <br>
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, <br>
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. <br>
        <q>'Tis some visitor,</q> I muttered, <q>tapping at my chamber door-</q><br>
            <blockquote>Only this, and nothing more.</blockquote> </p>
<br>
    <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, <br>
        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. <br>
        Eagerly I wished the morrow;-vainly I had sought to borrow <br>
        From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost Lenore-<br>
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-<br>
        <blockquote> Nameless here for evermore. </blockquote></p>
            <br>
    <p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain <br>
        Thrilled me-filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; <br>
        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, <br>
        <q>'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-<br>
        Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-</q><br>
        <blockquote> This it is, and nothing more. </blockquote></p>
            <br>
    <p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, <br>
        <q>Sir,</q> said I, <q>or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; <br>
        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, <br>
        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, <br>
        That I scarce was sure I heard you</q>-here I opened wide the door;-<br>
        <blockquote> Darkness there, and nothing more. </blockquote></p>
            <br>
    <p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, <br>
        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; <br>
        But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, <br>
        And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, <q>Lenore?</q> <br>
        This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, <q>Lenore?</q>-<br>
        <blockquote> Merely this, and nothing more.</blockquote></p>
            <br>
    <p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, <br>
        Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. <br>
        <q>Surely,</q> said I, <q>surely that is something at my window lattice: <br>
        Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-<br>
        Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-</q><br>
        <blockquote> 'Tis the wind and nothing more!</blockquote> </p>
            <br>
    <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, <br>
        In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;<br> 
        Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; <br>
        But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-<br>
        Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-<br>
        <blockquote> Perched, and sat, and nothing more. </blockquote></p>
            <br>
    <p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, <br>
        By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore. <br>
        <q>Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,</q> I said, <q>art sure no craven, <br>
        Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore-<br>
        Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!</q> <br>
        <blockquote> Quoth the Raven, <q>Nevermore.</q></blockquote> </p>
            <br>
    <p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, <br>
        Though its answer little meaning-little relevancy bore; <br>
        For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being <br>
        Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door-<br>
        Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, <br>
        <blockquote> With such name as <q>Nevermore.</q></blockquote> </p>
            <br>
    <p>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only <br>
        That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. <br>
        Nothing further then he uttered-not a feather then he fluttered-<br>
        Till I scarcely more than muttered, <q>Other friends have flown before-<br>
        On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.</q> <br>
        <blockquote> Then the bird said, <q>Nevermore.</q></blockquote></p>
            <br>
    <p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br> 
        <q>Doubtless,</q> said I, <q>what it utters is its only stock and store,<br> 
        Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster <br>
        Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-<br>
        Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore </q><br>
        <blockquote> Of 'Never-nevermore'.</blockquote></p>
            <br>
    <p>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, <br>
        Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; <br>
        Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking <br>
        Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-<br>
        What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore <br>
        <blockquote> Meant in croaking <q>Nevermore.</q></blockquote></p>
            <br>
    <p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing <br>
        To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; <br>
        This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining <br>
        On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, <br>
        But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er, <br>
        <blockquote> She shall press, ah, nevermore!</blockquote></p>
            <br>
    <p>Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer <br>
        Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor. <br>
        <q>Wretch,</q> I cried, <q>thy God hath lent thee-by these angels he hath sent thee <br>
        Respite-respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore! <br>
        Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!</q> <br>
        <blockquote> Quoth the Raven, <q>Nevermore.</q></blockquote></p>
            <br>
    <p><q>Prophet!</q> said I, <q>thing of evil! -prophet still, if bird or devil! -<br>
        Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, <br>
        Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-<br>
        On this home by Horror haunted-tell me truly, I implore-<br>
        Is there-is there balm in Gilead?-tell me-tell me, I implore!</q> <br>
        <blockquote> Quoth the Raven, <q>Nevermore.</q> </blockquote></p>
            <br>
    <p><q>Prophet!</q> said I, <q>thing of evil! -prophet still, if bird or devil! <br>
        By that Heaven that bends above us-by that God we both adore-<br>
        Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br> 
        It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-<br>
        Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.</q> <br>
        <blockquote> Quoth the Raven, <q>Nevermore.</q></blockquote> </p>
            <br>
    <p><q>Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,</q> I shrieked, upstarting-<br>
        <q>Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! <br>
        Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! <br>
        Leave my loneliness unbroken!-quit the bust above my door! <br>
        Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!</q> <br>
        <blockquote> Quoth the Raven, <q>Nevermore.</q></blockquote></p>
            <br>
    <p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting <br>
        On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; <br>
        And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, <br>
        And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; <br>
        And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor <br>
        <blockquote> Shall be lifted-nevermore!</blockquote></p>
